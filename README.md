# Secure-Banking
Secure Banking is a prototype command-line app that allows users to log into an ATM to view their bank account balance, history, desposit, and withdrawl funds securely using cryptographic techniques such as encryption, digital signatures, and authentication protocols.
## Requirements
The following libraries must be installed:

### Linux Ubuntu
    sudo pip install pycryptodomex
    sudo pip install pyopenssl
    sudo pip install pwinput

### Windows
    pip install pycryptodomex
    pip install pyopenssl
    pip install pwinput

## Instructions
Run the commands below in at least 2 terminal windows:

### Linux Ubuntu
    python3 bank.py
    python3 atm1.py
    python3 atm2.py

Enter "123456" for the valid user ID and "password" for the password.

### Windows
    python .\bank.py
    python .\atm1.py
    python .\atm2.py

Enter "123456" for the valid user ID and "password" for the password.

## Notes
All files other than the Python files and this README contain the public/private keys for the ATMs and bank. The bank only holds one account, and transaction history does not persist after server termination.
